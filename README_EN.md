Project made as a practice with the Unity engine inspired by the space battles of the Star Wars saga.

I am the author of programming. Graphic assets (3D models and Skybox) and music are not owned by me.

This game is not distributed commercially.

## Project build

The project is created using Unity 2021.3.5f1.

Just clone the repository or copy the files contained in it and open the project with Unity. The necessary resources will be installed automatically.

Once inside the Unity editor, the project can be modified and compiled.

## Game instructions

To move through the menus, you can use the mouse.

Use the WASD keys to move the ship, the mouse to move the camera and the left button to shoot. With the right mouse button you can toggle between the two shooting modes.

In Alliance mode you must eliminate all the ships on the stage before you can destroy the Death Star.

In Empire mode you must eliminate all the ships that try to destroy the Death Star.

## Game download
